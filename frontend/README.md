## What is RakshaMarg?

RakshaMarg is a navigation app built for safety. While most maps show you the fastest way to get somewhere, we show you the **safest** way.

We calculate safety scores for different routes based on things like street lighting, how busy the area is, and historical safety data. If you're walking alone at night or just want peace of mind, RakshaMarg helps you choose the path with the least risk.

## Key Features

*   **Safety Scores**: Every route gets a score (0-100) so you can compare choices at a glance.
*   **Smart Routing**: We suggest paths that avoid dark or isolated areas.
*   **Live Tracking**: Share your live location with friends or family. They can watch your journey in real-time.
*   **SOS Buton**: One tap to alert your trusted contacts if you feel unsafe.
*   **Safe Zones**: See nearby police stations, hospitals, and 24/7 public spaces along your way.

## Tech Stack

We built this using modern web technologies to make it fast and responsive.

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **Maps**: Google Maps API with custom layers
*   **Data Visualization**: Recharts & Framer Motion
