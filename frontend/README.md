## 🛡️ Vision

**RakshaMarg** is more than just a navigation app; it is a commitment to safety. We aim to empower women and all travelers to navigate urban environments with confidence, using AI-driven route analysis to predict and avoid potential safety hazards. By combining real-time data, community insights, and predictive safety scoring, we ensure that you are never walking alone.

## 💡 The Idea

In a world where safety is often a concern—especially at night—standard navigation apps focus solely on the fastest route. **RakshaMarg** prioritizes the **safest** route.

We leverage data on street lighting, crowd density, police station proximity, and historical safety records to compute a "Safety Score" for every path. Our goal is to provide informed decision-making power to the user, turning uncertainty into assurance.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Smart Route Analysis**: Unlike traditional maps, we analyze the *quality* of the route, not just the distance.
- **🛡️ Predictive Safety Scores**: Our AI evaluates multiple factors to give every route a safety rating (0-100), helping you choose the path of least risk.
- **👁️ Community Overwatch**: The "System Online" and "Live Tracking" features represent a connected community and active monitoring systems working to keep you safe.
- **📍 Safe Zones**: Instantly identify safe havens such as police stations, hospitals, and 24/7 public spaces along your route.
- **🔭 Real-time Insights**: Live updates on crowd density and lighting conditions (simulated).

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Women Commuters**: Providing an extra layer of security for daily travel.
- **Solo Travelers**: For those exploring new cities who need reliable local safety knowledge.
- **Night Owl Workers**: Ensuring a safe journey home after late shifts.
- **Concerned Parents/Guardians**: Peace of mind knowing loved ones are on the safest possible path.
